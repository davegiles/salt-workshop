# Saltstack Workshop

## Introduction

[Saltstack](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/) is a configuration management platform for managing large infrastructure. This workshop sets you up with a small cluster on your laptop and then walks through key concepts with explanations and hands on code & demo. You can follow along the tutorial trail and learn Saltstack. All you need is a laptop with sufficient resources to run a few VMs.
